# techdegree-project-6 A Content Scraper
A Node.js command line application that goes to an ecommerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet (CSV format).
The scraped information includes the product Title, Price, ImageURL, URL, and the Time of scraping.
If the ecommerce site is down, an readable error message will appear in the console.
If there is any error, the error will be logged in a file called scraper-error.log with the timestamp.
